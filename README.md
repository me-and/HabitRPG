# pyHabitRPG
A Python3 [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) API interface

I haven't actually used Habitica for many years, and I've no idea if this API still works.  I'm leaving it up in case it's useful to people – it was certainly useful to me when I was using Habitica regularly – but use at your own risk!
